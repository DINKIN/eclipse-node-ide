You can find more information in his <a href="http://girinstud.io/news/2013/09/crowdfunding-proposal-for-symmetrymirror-painting-in-gimp/" target="_blank">blog</a>, and there's a video of a proof-of-concept implementation on <a href="http://youtu.be/osSiETyae5c" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. If you care about GIMP as a tool for digital painting, supporting this project is likely to benefit your workflow.</p>
<p>While we are not ready for a full-fledged crowdfunding campaign for GIMP yet, we think that this kind of focused campaigns, tailored for particular audiences, definitely have merit.</p>
